            1. U.S.â€“China Trade Ceasefire Brings Temporary Relief
          </h2>
          <p>
            In a significant development, the United States and China have agreed to a 90-day
            reduction in tariffs, easing tensions between the two economic giants. This temporary
            truce has led to a notable rebound in global markets, with major indices posting their
            biggest gains since April. However, experts caution that while this agreement provides
            short-term relief, substantial gaps remain, and a final trade resolution will be
            challenging.
